    "**Exercise: Discretizing the asset space**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the situation in which we want to create an asset grid for the households in your favorite macro-model. Households choose assets from $[\\underline a, \\infty)$, need to discretize this grid. Idea: there should be more grid points around $\\underline a$, because policy function is more nonlinear here. But we also want some points for high $a$. Solution: *double exponential transformation of uniformly spaced grid*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a_i = \\underline a + e^{e^{u_i} - 1} - 1, u_i \\in [0, \\bar u]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `discretize_assets(amin, amax, n_a)` which outputs an asset grid ranging from `a_min` to `a_max` with `n_a` grid points, where $a_i$ is determined by the formula above."
